        <p>How you sit at your desk at work and at home can make a big difference in your long-term health.
            Many years ago, people did not understand the importance of ergonomics and good posture. But as more
            studies have been done and more data is released, it is becoming obvious that the working conditions
            we experience in our younger years can have a significant effect on our health as we get older. Back
            problems, aching joints, and other serious issues can all be the result of the chairs we sit in for
            the years that we work. Ergonomic seating has been created to help solve the long-term health issues
            associated with office work, and it is a subject that everyone needs to understand.
